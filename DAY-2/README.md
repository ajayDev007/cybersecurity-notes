## DAY-2(6/8/24)
## Virtual Machines and Kali Linux
### Topics discussed
__1. What are Virtual Machines(VMs):__ 
+ A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based computer that acts like a physical computer and can run programs, store data, and connect to networks. VMs are created from a pool of hardware resources and are isolated from the rest of the system by software called a hypervisor.
  
__2. Uses of VMs:__
       * Testing and Development: Developers often use VMs to test software in different environments without needing separate physical hardware.
* Server Consolidation: Organizations use VMs to run multiple servers on a single physical machine, reducing hardware costs.
* Security: VMs can be used to isolate potentially harmful applications or to create a safe environment for browsing or testing suspicious files.
* Disaster Recovery: VMs can be easily backed up and restored, making them useful for disaster recovery planning.
