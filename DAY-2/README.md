## DAY-2(6/8/24)
## Virtual Machines and Kali Linux
### Topics discussed
__1. What are Virtual Machines(VMs):__ 
+ A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based computer that acts like a physical computer and can run programs, store data, and connect to networks. VMs are created from a pool of hardware resources and are isolated from the rest of the system by software called a hypervisor.
  
__2. Uses of VMs:__
* _Testing and Development:_ Developers often use VMs to test software in different environments without needing separate physical hardware.
* _Server Consolidation:_ Organizations use VMs to run multiple servers on a single physical machine, reducing hardware costs.
* _Security:_ VMs can be used to isolate potentially harmful applications or to create a safe environment for browsing or testing suspicious files.
* _Disaster Recovery:_ VMs can be easily backed up and restored, making them useful for disaster recovery planning.
        
Virtual machines are essential tools in modern computing, enabling flexibility, efficiency, and security in various IT operations.

### Commonly used VMs
__1. Virtual Box__
* [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Download the required file from the link above and install it

__2. VMware Workstation__
* [VMware Workstation 17](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion)
* Download the file from the link about but you'll have to first register through Broadcom(the process is quite complicated)

### Kali Linux for Ethical Hacking
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kali Linux is an open-source distribution designed for cybersecurity professionals, ethical hackers, and penetration testers. It comes pre-loaded with a vast array of tools for various security-related tasks, making it a popular choice for those involved in security research, network security, and digital forensics.

__Kali Linux for Virtual Box__
* Download the pre-built VM of [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)
* Extract the zip file using [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org/download.html)
* Open Virutal Box and add the extracted file then open it.

  __Alternatives of Kali linux__
  While Kali Linux is a popular choice for penetration testing and cybersecurity tasks, several other Linux distributions offer similar capabilities. Here are some notable alternatives to Kali Linux:

<details>
           <summary>1. Parrot OS</summary>
           <p>* Parrot Security OS is a Debian-based distribution focused on security, privacy, and development. It is designed for penetration testing, forensics, reverse engineering, and cryptography.
* Features:
* Lightweight compared to Kali Linux.
* Comes with a wide range of tools similar to Kali Linux, but also includes privacy-oriented features like AnonSurf, which routes traffic through the Tor network.
* Includes development tools and environments for programming and scripting.</p>
